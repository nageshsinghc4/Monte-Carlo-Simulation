# Monte Carlo Simulation

### What is Monte Carlo Simulation?

Monte Carlo simulations are a wide class of computational algorithms that rely on repeated random sampling. The fundamental notion of Monte Carlo is to use randomness to resolve enigmas that might be deterministic in principle. Monte Carlo simulation is one of the most famous procedures to draw conclusions about a population without knowing the true fundamental population distribution. This sampling technique becomes beneficial particularly when one doesnâ€™t have the richness to repeatedly sample from the original population. 


"The intention behind Monte Carlo is that, as we use more samples, our solution should get more and more precise."
